# Raspberry Pi Club resources

These worksheets are intended to be quick-start activities. I am using these in my [Raspberry Pi themed CodeClub](http://richardhayler.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/raspberry-pi-codeclub-week-1.html) for Yrs 5-6. The pdfs in this repo have been de-branded and the school logo removed. 

I will add extra sheets as and when I create them.

These are originally created using Omnigraffle Pro but I have also exported as Visio XML files. 

Most of the activities are remixs of ideas found elsewhere. In most cases I have just condensed them down into a single sheet to try to avoid 'computing by numbers'.

##The following sheets are available:

1. **getting-started**: a single page diagram of where all the cables and peripherals go on a Pi
2. **linux-commands**: a 2 page guide to some of the most useful linux commands and some suggestions for things to try
3. **mallow**: an annotated Fritzing diagram for a simple marshmallow squeezing game
4. **single-led**: a breadboard project to light a single led using scratch (includes Fritzing diagram).
5. **running-python**: getting started with idle, this is an extension of single-led using Python code instead of Scratch. 
6. **GPIO**: a diagram of the GPIO pins for a model B, taken from [the excellent Raspberry Pi documentation](http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/ "Raspberry Pi documentation").
7. **reaction**: Add two button to the led to create a simple recation time game. Scratch will detect who pushed their button first when the led light up and display the winner.
8. **reactionPython**: The same game but using Python
9. **buzzer**: A simple circuit to make a piezo buzzer buzz. Uses both Scratch(which is only really capable of making the buzzer tick) and Python.  

I try to maintain a [blog](http://richardhayler.blogspot.co.uk/ "Easily Distracted - my blog") about how the club is going and what has worked well and worked less well each week. This will conatin more information about how each handout is used. 

I'll tweet about any updates <a href="https://twitter.com/rdhayler">Follow @rdhayler</a>
