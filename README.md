# Raspberry Pi Club resources

These [Suishi cards](http://kata.coderdojo.com/wiki/Sushi) are intended to be quick-start activities. I am using these in my [Raspberry Pi themed CodeClub](http://richardhayler.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/raspberry-pi-codeclub-week-1.html) for Yrs 5-6 and at [CoderDojo Ham](http://www.coderdojoham.org/) 

I will add extra sheets as and when I create them. Sheets marked as BETA are new and have not yet been fully tested in clubs/CoderDojo.

These are originally created using Omnigraffle Pro.

Most of the activities are remixs of ideas found elsewhere. In most cases I have just condensed them down into a single sheet to try to avoid 'computing by numbers'.

Some of the cards are available in two types: -half and -mini. This refers to the size of breadboard shown in the diagram.

All projects are designed for the model B but should work with B+ and Pi 2. 

###Components

Most of the components used in the hardware projects acan be acquired fairly cheaply, especially if you're prepared to wait a while for shipping from China. I've put together a [Pinterest Page](https://uk.pinterest.com/top_shed/coderdojo-ham-raspberry-pi-components/) that has links to some suggested places where the bits and bobs can be purchased. I cannot, of course offer any guarantee or promise that the products will always be available, be the cheapest or most reliable. YMMV.

##The following sheets are available:

1. **GettingStarted**: a single page diagram of where all the cables and peripherals go on a Pi
2. 
3. **mallow**: an annotated Fritzing diagram for a simple marshmallow squeezing game
4. **led-scratch**: a breadboard project to light a single led using scratch (includes Fritzing diagram).
4.1 **led-gpiozeroBETA**: a breadboard project to light a single led using Python and GPIOZero 
4.2 **pwmled-gpiozeroBETA**: Vary the brightness of an LED through PWM with GPIOZero
4.3 **RGBLed-gpiozeroBETA**: Control the colours of an RGB LED using GPIOZero
5. **running-python3**: getting started with idle, intended for people who are new to Python
6. **reaction-gpiozerBETA**: Add two button to the led from project 4/5 to create a simple recation time game. Scratch will detect who pushed their button first when the led lights up and display the winner. Also includes a (better) Python version.
7. **buzzerBIG-gpiozeroBETA**: A simple circuit to make a piezo buzzer buzz. Uses both Scratch(which is only really capable of making the buzzer tick) and Python.  
8. **alarm-gpiozeroBETA**: Combine a cheap PIR sensor with the buzzer from project 7 to create a simple intruder alarm.
9. **minecraft_gold**: Create a trail of golden blocks behind you.
10. **minecraft_tnt**: Modify the property of a TNT block to prime it for explosion.
11. **minecraft_biggerboom**: Set off an explosion in Minecraft with a real world button. Add a flshing LED and a buzzer for a more dramatic countdown to detonation.
12. **sevensegment**: Control a seven segment led matrix.
13. **LDRLED-gpiozerBETA**: Use a Light Dependent Resistor to turn on/off an LED. 
14. **TrafficLights**: Can you program a traffic leght sequence (challenge card)
15. **minecraft-frozen**: create a freeze ray in minecraft and control its range with a variable resistor
16. **piglowV3**: Use the PiGlow add-on board with Scratch and Python
17. **StepperBETA**: Control a stepper motor through GPIOZero

####Extras:

**GPIO**: a diagram of the GPIO pins for a model B, taken from [the excellent Raspberry Pi documentation](http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/ "Raspberry Pi documentation").

**minecraftblocks**: a list of the block types available in Minecraft Pi edition.

I try to maintain a [blog](http://richardhayler.blogspot.co.uk/ "Easily Distracted - my blog") about how the club is going and what has worked well and worked less well each week. This will contain more information about how each Suishi card is used. 

I'll tweet about any updates <a href="https://twitter.com/rdhayler">Follow @rdhayler</a>
