# Raspberry Pi Club resources

These [Suishi cards](http://kata.coderdojo.com/wiki/Sushi) are intended to be quick-start activities. I am using these in my [Raspberry Pi themed CodeClub](http://richardhayler.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/raspberry-pi-codeclub-week-1.html) for Yrs 5-6 and at [CoderDojo Ham](http://www.coderdojoham.org/) The pdfs in this repo have been de-branded and the school/CoderDojo logos removed. 

I will add extra sheets as and when I create them.

These are originally created using Omnigraffle Pro but I have also exported as Visio XML files. 

Most of the activities are remixs of ideas found elsewhere. In most cases I have just condensed them down into a single sheet to try to avoid 'computing by numbers'.

Some of the cards are available in two types: -half and -mini. This refers to the size of breadboard shown in the diagram. 

##The following sheets are available:

1. **GettingStarted**: a single page diagram of where all the cables and peripherals go on a Pi
2. **linux-commands**: a 2 page guide to some of the most useful linux commands and some suggestions for things to try
3. **mallow**: an annotated Fritzing diagram for a simple marshmallow squeezing game
4. **single-led**: a breadboard project to light a single led using scratch (includes Fritzing diagram).
5. **running-python**: getting started with idle, this is an extension of single-led using Python code instead of Scratch. 
6. **reaction**: Add two button to the led from project 4/5 to create a simple recation time game. Scratch will detect who pushed their button first when the led lights up and display the winner. Also includes a (better) Python version.
7. **buzzer**: A simple circuit to make a piezo buzzer buzz. Uses both Scratch(which is only really capable of making the buzzer tick) and Python.  
8. **alarm**: Combine a cheap PIR sensor with the buzzer from project 7 to create a simple intruder alarm.
9. **minecraft_gold**: Create a trail of golden blocks behind you.
10. **minecraft_tnt**: Modify the property of a TNT block to prime it for explosion.
11. **minecraft_biggerboom**: Set off an explosion in Minecraft with a real world button. Add a flshing LED and a buzzer for a more dramatic countdown to detonation.
12. **sevensegment**: Control a seven segment led matrix.
13. **LDR**: Use a Light Dependent Resistor to estaimet changes in brightness. 
14. **TrafficLights**: Can you program a traffic leght sequence (challenge card)

####Extras:

**GPIO**: a diagram of the GPIO pins for a model B, taken from [the excellent Raspberry Pi documentation](http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/ "Raspberry Pi documentation").

**minecraftblocks**: a list of the block types available in Minecraft Pi edition.

I try to maintain a [blog](http://richardhayler.blogspot.co.uk/ "Easily Distracted - my blog") about how the club is going and what has worked well and worked less well each week. This will contain more information about how each Suishi card is used. 

I'll tweet about any updates <a href="https://twitter.com/rdhayler">Follow @rdhayler</a>
